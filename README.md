# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Python code to detect fraud transactions in a financial dataset. The columns are 'Time' which is the time taken for the given transaction to occur from the first transaction, amount in dollars and a class column which gives 0 if it's a non-fraud transaction and 1 if it's a fraud detection. The other columns are just named V1,V2 etc because the banks cannot release that information as it is sensitive.

I used Decision Tree classifiers, Logistic Regression and K-means clustering to train and test my models.
